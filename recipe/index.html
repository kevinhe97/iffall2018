	<h3>What's the Story behind Cai Fan?</h3>
	<p>Cai Fan is simply put, steamed rice with chopped salted pork and an assortment of vegetables. I remember the first time I ate Cai Fan when I was 13. My mom had decided to take the easy route that night, and instead of making my favorite fried rice, she decided to make Cai Fan instead. I was instantly hooked, and I begged my mom to make some more. Then, before I left for college, my mom decided to pass on this recipe to me, so that whenever I was feeling tired, lazy, or just home-sick, I could make a simple and easy rice-cooker meal to warm myself right up. This is Cai Fan.</p>
