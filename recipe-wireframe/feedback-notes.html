<h1>Feedback Notes - Kevin He</h1>

<ol>
<li>Rearrange the heading order so that the "Simple Rice Cooker Meal" is a true header while the small illustration and name of the dish falls right below it as a sticky header with a menu navigation icon</li>
<li>Make the ingredients single column without images just for legibility's sake</li>
<li>Add a small section below the sticky with another illustration that just gives context behind the dish, why I chose it, and why it's cool/important!</li>
<li>Make sure steps are clear, distinct, timed (when necessary), and separate into simple and distinguishable steps.</li>
<li>Make readability and the hierarchy the most important aspects!!!</li>
</ol>
