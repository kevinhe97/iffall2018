<p class="Verse">
	<br><p class="type">VERSE 1: CISE STARR</p>
	Light as a <span class="feather">feather</span> when I'm floating through
<br>Reading through the daily news
<br>Measuring the hurt within the golden rule
<br>Centimetres of ether, I'm heating the speaker
<br>Motivational teacher with words that burn people
<br>Seeing the headlines lined with discord
<br>It's either genocide or the planet in uproar
<br>Never good. The rules of paradise are never nice
<br>The best laid plans of Mice and Men are never right
<br>I'm just a Vagabond with Flowers for Algernon
<br>An Average Joe who knows what the fuck is going on
<br>It's the hope of my thoughts that I travel upon
<br>Fly like an arrow of God until I'm gone, so I'm

<p class="Hook"></p>
	<br><p class="type">HOOK: CISE STARR</p>
	Drifting away like a <span class="feather">feather</span> in air
<br>Letting my words take me away from the hurt and despair
<br>So I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator
<br>Drifting away like a <span class="feather">feather</span> in air
<br>Letting my soul take me away from the hurt and despair
<br>So I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator
<br>Riding the escalator to the something that is greater

<p class="Verse"></p>
	<br><p class="type">VERSE 2: AKIN</p>
	Taking chances, word tap dancing with wolves
<br>In an ice arena out there, deep in the woods of
<br>Arizona, the sun be high, life's ironic
<br>Ain't trying to be Dalí when I write surreal life
<br>I paint it vivid, habitat crazy insane
<br>Watch the propaganda six o'clock news and it’s saying
<br>Cultures clash, for black folk and white trash
<br>They revel in the cyberspace that might crash, dash
<br>To millennium a million miles of running
<br>At the speed of now back, don't return gunning
<br>Rambo style, gung ho child gunning
<br>Ammo blao two times loud stunning
<br>Stunning, when I hit ya, lift you off the Earth like
<br>Ayo, take you right back to birth and
<br>Niggas wonder why, they might wonder why
<br>This shit might happen but it does, they go

	<br><p class="type">HOOK: CISE STARR</p>
	Drifting away like a <span class="feather">feather</span> in air
<br>Letting my words take me away from the hurt and despair
<br>So I'm keeping it vertical forever elevator
<br>Drifting away like a <span class="feather">feather</span> in air

	<br><p class="type">VERSE 3: CISE STARR</p>
	Treat you better than me, cause that's the heavenly key
<br>To unlock the inner strength where my essence will be
<br>It's the knowledge of self, understanding of the things around me
<br>That becomes the wisdom that I need
<br>Living this life to the best of my ability
<br>Channeling energy to my thoughts into your symmetry
<br>Remember me, because my prose remain gold
<br>I got the gift of gab like them pimps in Kangol
<br>It never ends, I keep it ruling like a cypher
<br>The first caveman bringing fire
<br>Innovating and higher; to blast mistakes I raise the stakes
<br>It's double or nothing in this vaccuumless space
<br>I will, survive, divine the time to cry
<br>Fuck a hold or hide, I'm alive with pride
<br>And I drove the Chevy to the Levy
<br>But the Levy was dry, singing "This will be the day that I die"
